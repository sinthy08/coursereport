Part of the adjustments is that they require a new course report based on Business Units (BU) which are stored as custom profile fields. It aggregated report where all records are grouped by business unit.
The following table is a mockup of the report:

Computation of the Columns

1. Passed: the percentage of users in a specific business unit who have completed the course.
2. Average Progress: if the course has completion tracking, then compute the average progress for the business unit.
3. Average Completion Time: how much time does it take to complete the course, on average, per b
